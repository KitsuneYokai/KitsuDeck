# KitsuDeck

KitsuDeck will be a makro keyboard for a ESP32 with a 7" touch screen display. 
It will be able to start programs on your pc, or invoke F13- F... keys / makros, or even
controll your spotify client.

I have some ideas for the future, but I will see how far I get with this project.

## Hardware

- [ESP32-8048S070](https://aliexpi.com/Xd6v) (7" touch screen) (other LVGL screens, with an ESP32 should work too, but I have not tested them yet, cause i have no other screens)
- probably a 3D printed case(will be uploaded later, when it is finished)
- powersupply (I have yet to find one, that fits the ESP HMI(using the usb-c port for now))
- maybe a battery in the future (idk about that yet)
- MicroSD card(worked with a 8GB one, but I have not tested it with larger ones yet) (format it to FAT. FAT32 should work too, but I have not tested it yet)

## Software

- [LVGL](https://lvgl.io/) (for the GUI)
- [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) (for the ESP32)
- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) (for the ESP32)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (for the IDE)
- [SquarelineStudio](https://squareline.io/) (for the GUI design)(source will be uploaded later, when it is finished)

## How to use
more info will be added later on since the project is still in development and there might be some changes
